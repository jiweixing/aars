<h3>BIT-AARS - ARM Assembly and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 0.2</h4>
<h4>May 2020</h4>
<h4>Cool Capability: Plug-in Tools</h4>
</center>

Old tools in MARS 4.5 are selected and modified for usage in ARM.
Just like MARS 4.5, AARS 0.2 is capable of running externally-developed software that meets a set of requirements.
Everyone is encouraged to contribute new tools to this system.

The requirements for such a program are:
<ol>
<li>It implements the <tt>aars.tools.MarsTool</tt> interface.
<li>It is part of the <tt>aars.tools</tt> package.
<li>It compiles cleanly into a ".class" file, stored in the <tt>aars/tools</tt> directory.
</ol>
AARS will detect all qualifying tools upon startup and include them in
its Tools menu. 
When a tool's menu item is selected, an instance of it will be created using its no-argument
constructor and its <tt>action()</tt> method will be invoked.
If no qualifying tools are found at AARS startup, the Tools menu will not 
appear.
