<p>
    Hello, we want to say thanks again for using AARS!
<p>
    Currently we are Undergraduates in Beijing Institute of Techenology. We wrote this software under the help from A.P. Ji from BIT . It feel beyond good to have you all!
<p>
    Being confined to time, AARS still has many imperfections. And we will try to imporve our AARS in the future. 
<p>
    In the end, we want to say thanks to Pete and Ken, by whom MARS was written, for the excellent work you have done. Besides, we also want to say thans to Yueyan Zhao, who wrote the BIT-RARS.  
<p>
