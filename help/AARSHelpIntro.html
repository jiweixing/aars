<h3>BIT-AARS - ARM Assembly and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 0.2</h4>
<h4>May 2020</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
</center>
BIT-AARS is a work base on MARS(http://www.cs.missouristate.edu/MARS/).
<p>
<p>BIT stands for <b>B</b>eijing <b>I</b>nstitute of <b>T</b>echnology</p>
AARS, the <b>Advanced RISC Machine</b> <b>A</b>ssembler and <b>R</b>untime <b>S</b>imulator,
will assemble and simulate the execution of ARM assembly language programs.
It can be used through its integrated development environment (IDE).  
AARS is written in Java and requires at least Release 1.6 of the J2SE Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to work.
It is distributed as an executable JAR file.
The source code can be found at <tt><b>https://github.com/jiweixing/bit-aars</b></tt>.

<p>As of Release 0.2, AARS assembles and simulates over 30 basic instructions of the AARS
instruction set, few pseudo-instructions or instruction variations, several syscall functions
mainly for console, random number generation and more.  These are listed in separate help tabs.
<p>
When writing AARS, the reference is "" and "https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~waldroj/3d1/arm_arm.pdf". 
Although work has been done according to the standard format and usage of ARM as much as possible,
    we still have to compromise a lot for our work is based on MARS which is a tool for MIPS.
