<h3> Introduction to macros</h3>
<p><b>Macro</b> is <i>a pattern-matching and replacement facility
    that provides a simple mechanism to name a frequently used sequence of instructions</i>.
    This permits the programmer to specify the instruction sequence by invoking the macro. This requires
    only one line of code for each use instead of repeatedly typing
    in the instruction sequence each time. It follows the axiom "define once, use many times," which
    not only reduces the chance for error but also facilitates program maintenance.</p>


<p>As a simple example, you may want to terminate your program from a number of locations. If you are running
    from the AARS IDE, you will use system call 10, <tt>exit</tt>. The instruction sequence is pretty easy</p>

but still tedious. You can define a macro, let's call it <tt>done</tt>, to represent this sequence
then invoke it whenever you wish with the statement
At assembly time, the assembler will replace each occurrence of the statement <tt>done</tt> with the two-statement
sequence
This is the macro expansion. The runtime simulator is unaware of macros or macro expansion.</p>

<p>If running AARS from the command line, perhaps you want to return a termination value. This can be done
    with syscall 17, <tt>exit2</tt>, which takes the termination value as an argument. An equivalent macro,
    let's call it <tt>terminate</tt> would be
This macro defines a <i>formal parameter</i> to represent the termination value. You would invoke it
with the statement
<pre>
		terminate (1)</pre>
to terminate with value 1. Upon assembly,
the statement <tt>terminate (1)</tt> would be replaced by the three-statement sequence
The <i>argument value</i>, 1, is substituted wherever the formal parameter <tt>%termination_value</tt> appears
in the macro body.
This is a textual substitution. Note that in this example the argument value must be an integer, not a
register name or a label, because the parameter is used as the second operand in the Load Immediate operation.</p>

<p>In AARS, a macro is similar to an extended (pseudo) instruction. They are distinguished in that the expansion of
    extended instructions is supported by an internally-defined specification language and mechanism which can
    manipulate argument values.
    The macro facility can only substitute argument values as given, and it uses a separate mechanism from extended
    instructions. </p>

<p>addtional examples and details follow.</p>

<h3> How to define macros </h3>
The first line begins with a <tt>.macro</tt> directive followed by an optional list of formal parameters.
Placing commas between parameters and parentheses around the list is optional.
<p>
    Each formal parameter is an identifier that begins with a <tt>%</tt> character. For compatibility with
    the SPIM preprocessor APP, it may alternatively begin with <tt>$</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    The lines that follow define the body of the macro. Use the formal parameters as appropriate. The body
    may contain data segments as well as text segments.
</p>
<p>The macro definition finishes with a <tt>.endm</tt> directive.
</p>
<p>See the Notes below for addtional information.</p>

<h3> How to use macros</h3>

To invoke a macro, form a statement consisting of the macro name and then one token for each argument
to be substituted for its corresponding formal parameter by the assembler.
The argument list may optionally be surrounded by parentheses.
Arguments may be separated either by spaces or commas.
<p>
    Macro expansion is a pre-processing task for assemblers.

<h3> Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A macro definition must appear before its use. No forward references.
    </li>
    <li>
        All macro definitions are local in each file and they cannot be global.
    </li>
    <li>
        Nested macro definitions are not supported. No <tt>.macro</tt> directive should appear inside body of a macro
        definition.
    </li>
    <li>
        A macro definition can contain a call to a previously-defined macro. Only backward references are allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Labels placed in the body of a macro definition will not have same name after macro expansion.
        During expansion, their name will be followed by "_M#" where # will be a unique number for each macro expansion.
    </li>
    <li>
        Two macros with the same name but different number of parameters are considered different and both can be used.
    </li>
    <li>
        A macro defined with the same name and same number of parameters as another macro defined before it will be
        ignored.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each argument in a macro call can only be a single language element (token).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3> Examples</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Printing an integer (argument may be either an immediate value or register name)
</tt></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Printing a string (macro will first assign a label to its parameter in data segment then print it):
    </li>
    <li>
        The <tt>for</tt> macro has 4 parameters. <tt>%regIterator</tt> should be the name of a register which iterates
        from <tt>%from</tt> to <tt>%to</tt> and in each iteration <tt>%bodyMacroName</tt> will be expanded and run.
        Arguments for
        <tt>%from</tt> and <tt>%to</tt> must be an immediate value(using a register still need improvement to support
        more pesudo_inst), and <tt>%bodyMacroName</tt>
        should be name of a macro that has no parameters.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>The .eqv directive</h3>
<p>The <tt>.eqv</tt> directive (short for "equivalence") is similar to <tt>#define</tt> in C
    or C++. It is used to substitute an arbitrary string for an identifier. It is useful but much less powerful than
    macros.
    It was developed independently of the macro facility.
</p>
<p>Using <tt>.eqv</tt>, you can specify simple substitutions that provide "define once, use many times" capability at
    assembly
    pre-processing time. For example, once you define

which when run will display the values 0 through 19 on one line with no intervening spaces.
</p>
<p>Note that the substitution string is not limited to a single token. Like <tt>.macro</tt>, <tt>.eqv</tt> is local to
    the file
    in which it is defined, and must be defined prior to use. Macro bodies can contain references to <tt>.eqv</tt>
    directives.
